On the page there is an approach how to work around a driver prompt while installing.




## Version note

```bash
u@h:~$ cat /etc/debian_version

u@h:~$
```
## Content

During an installation one can meet a message *Cannot find firmware file blabla.ucode* or a need to use a wifi connection of which there is a lack in the moment. Then prepare a flash (gwizdek) of an unpacked archive of drivers before the installation. Download from there:
